**🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project! 🎧**

I recently built a **Spotify Clone** using only **HTML** and **CSS**, which mimics the popular music streaming platform's sleek user interface. This was a fun way to enhance my front-end development skills, and I'm thrilled to have it live now!

**Project Highlights:**
- Clean and responsive design 🌐
- Built entirely with HTML and CSS 🎨

I'm looking forward to adding more functionality soon, like integrating APIs for music streaming and user interactions.
